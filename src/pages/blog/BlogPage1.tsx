                        At Société General Global Solution Centre (SG GSC), we are a diverse
                        workforce fostered in an inclusive environment where each individual can
                        bring their whole authentic selves to the workplace and contribute equally
                        to the firm’s value generation, which includes delivering an enriching
                        client experience by developing innovative solutions in house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Globally, Société General employs 147,000 people, which comprises of 59%
                        women and more that 138 nationalities. We have signed two public charters
                        to reaffirm our commitment to inclusion and diversity: The International
                        Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Business and Disability charter, which promotes
                        the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the workplace, and the United
                        Nations Women Empowerment Principles, that aims to empower women in the
                        workplace, marketplace and community. The principles of these charter are
                        applied to all entities of the SG group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In India, with robust support from the management and the HR functions, our
                        diversity and inclusion initiatives are carried out in a structured manner
                        with an established Diversity and Inclusion Council. The council works on 4
                        key tenets: Inclusion, Gender Diversity, People with Disabilities Diversity
                        and Plus Diversity. The last covers LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
                        Transgender and more), age and geographic diversity as well. The Diversity
                        and Inclusion Council is committed to encourage a culture of inclusion,
                        openness and respect for all employees at SG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The D&amp;I initiatives are publicly supported and endorsed by our CEO,
                        Sunil Shah and is sponsored by 3 SGGSC Executive Committee Directors, David
                        VERDIER, Matthew RUNECKLES and Etienne HURET.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The D&amp;I initiatives in India can be broadly divided into 3 main
                        categories: ‘Bring your whole self to work’, i.e. to create an open and
                        inclusive workplace, ‘Attract and Retain a diverse talent pool’ and
                        ‘Develop and Grow talent’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Bring your whole self to work - Create an open and inclusive workplace
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe an inclusion journey begins in knowing the employees pulse and
                        understanding if they truly feel as if they are a part of the SG family -
                        an employee is engaged when they can bring their whole authentic self to
                        the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this principle in mind, we started our inclusion journey with an
                        employee survey that was rolled out across the organization, to understand
                        the existing inherent biases. Post this, multiple dialogues were organized
                        via business line connects with leadership and focus group discussions with
                        employees. In conjunction with the survey, two tools, ‘Amy’ and ‘Amber’
                        were deployed to keep a continuous tab on the employee pulse and
                        engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, unconscious bias trainings and awareness campaigns were
                        launched to enable employees to delve deeper and learn to celebrate the
                        diversity in our workplace, respect differences - not just the differences
                        that are visible but also the rich diversity of thought that each of us
                        brings to the table. Our inclusion trainings were designed as interactive
                        theatre workshops to better foster the development of an all-inclusive
                        mindset. Also, specific trainings were planned for the hiring and
                        front-line managers to help them identify and manage their unconscious
                        biases, thereby creating a conducive environment for our existing and
                        future employees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can only bring our whole selves to work when there is no fear – fear of
                        judgement, fear of harassment, or fear of discrimination. At SG, we have a
                        zero-tolerance policy towards harassment in all its forms, with redressal
                        steps already in place. In the case of sexual harassment for example, there
                        is a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) council that ensures fair
                        redressal of complaints. Since the safety of our employees is paramount,
                        multiple policies have been implemented to ensure a safe work environment.
                        Before Covid, self-defense classes were also conducted to make our women
                        employees self-reliant and confident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To foster a culture that encourages free expression and creates a sense of
                        belonging, we now have communities focusing on women (India Women’s Network
                        – IWN), PWD (PWD community) and LGBT+ (Pride and Allies community). The
                        LGBT+ community also has additional support in an ERG for LGBT+ with
                        frequent coffee connects with management and a newly launched reverse
                        mentoring program. We also recognize the importance of mental health and
                        the role it plays in overall employee wellbeing, whether we are talking
                        about post-partum depression or accepting and living with disability or
                        even coming out as part of the LGBT+ community. To help employees in their
                        individual journeys to acceptance, we also have a confidential one-on-one
                        counselling resource available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our HR policies are periodically reviewed to take into consideration
                        employee feedback, ensuring that they are aligned to creating a more
                        inclusive workplace. We extended maternity policies to include adoption and
                        surrogacy, as well as made creches available to both parents instead of
                        only mothers and supported infertility treatments to cover the diverse
                        needs of all employees in relation to childcare. The policies were attuned
                        to be inclusive of the LGBT+ community as well with the introduction of
                        same sex partner insurance and medical coverage for gender affirmation
                        surgery.

                        Traditionally it was believed that flexible work hours are crucial for
                        women to help them manage office and work, but we have realized that
                        flexibility is a need of all and not just women. Creating an environment
                        which is gender agnostic encourages partners/spouses to contribute equally
                        at home. Thus, our Flexi-Office hours with work from home was made
                        available to all employees to help them balance the needs at work and at
                        life. We are attempting towards creating a workplace where there is no
                        “equality” but there is “equity”.

                        The talent acquisition teams in SG keep a close tab on the diversity hiring
                        funnel and potential hiring biases. To attract potential employees from
                        diverse backgrounds, we have run focused hiring drives for women, PWD and
                        the LGBT+ community. We have had focused hiring of women from all women
                        colleges and colleges with more than 30% gender diversity ratios. Our
                        ‘Returnship’ program targets women who are coming back to work after a
                        break and focusses on ensuring a smooth transition for these women with
                        targeted upskill initiatives.

                        SG hosts an annual event – ‘Connexion’ for People with Disabilities with
                        NGOs and other corporates to create a social impact on the development of
                        talent with disabilities. We worked with more than 300 PWD participants in
                        Connexion 2019 to help them create their resumes and partnered with
                        LinkedIn to help them create their professional presence as well.

                    <p>
                        We also run hackathons and PWD focused hiring drives to increase our access
                        to this diverse pool set. In continuation with the context of equity, we

                        enable staff disability to work to their fullest potential. In addition to
                        office changes that are in progress, some key initiatives that have helped
                        us create the equity for PWD are; sign language training for all SG
                        employees and all SG townhalls mandated to run with sign Language

                        leadership to have the right support for growth in key business portfolios.
                        The Women in Leadership program is aimed towards women in mid-management to
